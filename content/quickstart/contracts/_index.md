This project will be named `{namespace}.{feature}.Api.Contracts`.

In this project, we will define the document that describes how the API works. Its components depend on what you choose to implement your API.
- Dtos for REST
- Protos for gRPC
- IntegrationEvents for event bus
- Anything else you need...
