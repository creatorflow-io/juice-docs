If you are completed implementing your app with all necessary functions, we will only be interested in integrating with other services here.
- Build your minimal app based on implemented domain features
- Integrate with the authentication/authorization services
- Integration testing with an event bus like RabbitMQ or another service bus

Again, we will accept that there is no standard layout for microservices, it depends on the situation and purpose of the service. It may be complex or simple like the images below.
