The IOutboxService&lt;TContext> stores events in an OutboxEvent table inside your DbContext transaction; a separate DeliveryHostedService picks them up and forwards them to the broker.
When to use Your command handler modifies domain state and must publish a message atomically You are replacing direct IEventBus.PublishAsync() calls from v8.5.0 You want to publish plain domain events without converting them to IntegrationEvent The delivery worker may run in a separate process or be added later Prerequisites Internal Messaging Setup — required for TransactionBehavior’s DbContext dependency injection.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://juice-docs.creatorflow.io/core/messaging/outbox/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
